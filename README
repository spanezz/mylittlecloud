# My Little Cloud

This is a simple Django site for cloud file sharing.

Site users can create file areas where they can upload files and share them
with others.

File areas are published publicly behind secret, hard-to-guess links.

## Project state

The code worked and should be quite straightforward, but I consider it
unfinished, and I do not intend to develop it further.

I still think the world needs a simple service like this one, so I share it in
the hope that you pick it up and turn it into a releaseable, useable tool.
